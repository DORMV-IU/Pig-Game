A simple game with simple rules.

1. Each player can 'roll' a die to receive a score.
2. A player can continously roll that die. The score will continually add-up unless the player rolls a '1'. If this condition is met, the accumulated score will be reset to zero and the player's turn will conclude.
3. Alternatively, a player can choose to 'hold' their current score when they are satisfied. This will add it to their total score and their turn will conclude.
4. The first player's total score to accumulate to 100 wins the game!
